# Joseph Deshaies Web Development Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to have a site beyond a simple resume that potential employers could view and get a better understanding of myself as a candidate for the job. This site allows the potential employer to read about who I am and know me better on a personal level. This portfolio also allows me to showcase my skillset and capabilities not only by the design and functionality of the site itself, but also by linking 5 work samples. The work section of the site allows the employer to click any sample and be directed to a page of the actual application to see what I've accomplished. Overall, this site will help give anyone viewing a solid understanding of my coding skills. Lastly, this site also allows the potential employer to reach out to me for any reason by listing my phone number, email address (that they can click and have a new email pop up), LinkedIn profile, and GitHub profile.

Although there are just placholders for the sample work, I built this project to eventually link the applications I am most proud of for someone to easily access and view. I also built this project to test my knowledge and apply what I've learned on HTMl and CSS. Not only did I have to ensure the structure of the site was setup appropriately, but I had to come up with a overall style for the portfolio that was applied correctly and was responsive depending on the size of the viewport. This site will continue to be a work in progress as my knowledge improves and I become of more features I want to add to the portfolio to help me stand out more as a candidate to potential employers.
